## Design Patterns Implemented

### 1. Color Schemes
```typescript
- Primary: Blue palette for main actions
- Success: Green for positive feedback
- Warning: Yellow for cautions
- Danger: Red for critical actions
- Info: Light blue for information
```

### 2. Typography Scale
```typescript
- Consistent font sizes (xs to 5xl)
- Standardized font weights
- Proper line heights for readability
```

### 3. Spacing System
```typescript
- Consistent spacing scale (0 to 32)
- Standardized component padding
- Uniform gaps and margins
```

### 4. Animation Standards
```typescript
- Fade, slide, and scale animations
- Consistent duration (150ms to 500ms)
- Smooth easing functions
```

## Usage Examples

### Using StatCard
```tsx
<StatCard
  title="Total Clients"
  value={stats.totalClients}
  subtitle="All time"
  icon={UsersIcon}
  trend={8}
  variant="info"
/>
```

### Using DataTable
```tsx
<DataTable
  data={clients}
  columns={clientColumns}
  keyAccessor="id"
  onRowClick={handleRowClick}
  showPagination={true}
/>
```

### Using Modal
```tsx
<Modal
  isOpen={isOpen}
  onClose={handleClose}
  title="Client Details"
  size="lg"
>
  {/* Modal content */}
</Modal>
```
