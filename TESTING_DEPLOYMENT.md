## Testing Infrastructure

### Unit Testing
```bash
# Run all unit tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Generate coverage report
npm run test:coverage

# Run specific test file
npm test CrisisButton.test.tsx
```

**Coverage Requirements:**
- Minimum 70% overall coverage
- 80% for critical components (crisis, auth, therapy)
- 90% for utility functions

### Integration Testing
API endpoints are tested with comprehensive integration tests:
- Authentication flows
- Crisis intervention endpoints
- AI therapy interactions
- Community features
- Data protection validation

### End-to-End Testing
```bash
# Run E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run with UI mode for debugging
npm run test:e2e:ui

# Run specific browser
npx playwright test --project=chromium
```

**Critical User Flows Tested:**
- Crisis intervention accessibility
- Emergency resource availability
- User registration and authentication
- Therapy session workflows
- Privacy mode functionality

### Security Testing
```bash

- Incident response readiness

### HIPAA Compliance Checklist
Review the comprehensive checklist at: `security/HIPAA-COMPLIANCE-CHECKLIST.md`

Key requirements:
- End-to-end encryption for all ePHI
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Access controls and authentication
- Regular security assessments
- Incident response procedures
- Business Associate Agreements

### Sensitive Data Protection
- All PII encrypted at rest (AES-256)
- TLS 1.3 for data in transit
- Field-level encryption for sensitive fields
- Secure key management
- Data anonymization for analytics

3. **Unit & Integration Tests** - Full test suite with coverage
4. **E2E Tests** - Critical user flow validation
5. **Accessibility Testing** - WCAG compliance
6. **Performance Testing** - Lighthouse CI
7. **Docker Build** - Multi-platform image creation
8. **Deployment** - Automated staging/production deployment
