### Audit Event Structure

Each audit event contains the following HIPAA-required information:

```typescript
interface AuditEvent {
  // Event identification (REQUIRED)
  eventId: string;           // Unique event identifier
  timestamp: string;         // ISO 8601 timestamp
  category: AuditEventCategory;

  action: string;            // Action performed
  outcome: AuditOutcome;     // SUCCESS | FAILURE | PARTIAL_SUCCESS
  description: string;       // Human-readable description
  
  // Actor information (REQUIRED)
  userId: string;            // User who performed action
  userEmail: string;         // User's email address

}
```

### Data Retention

Audit logs are retained according to HIPAA requirements:

- **Default Retention**: 7 years (2,555 days) - HIPAA minimum
- **Security Events**: 10 years (3,650 days) - Extended retention
- **Critical Events**: Permanent retention until manual review

### Encryption and Security

All audit events are encrypted before storage:

### Compliance Scoring

Each compliance report includes a score (0-100) based on:

- **Audit Coverage**: Percentage of activities logged
- **Security Incident Rate**: Frequency of security events  
- **Access Control Compliance**: Proper authorization rates
- **Data Integrity**: Successful integrity checks
- **Response Times**: Incident response effectiveness

## Implementation Details

### Database Schema

```sql
-- Audit events table with partitioning
CREATE TABLE "AuditEvent" (
    "id" SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    "eventId" TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    "timestamp" TIMESTAMP(3) NOT NULL,
    "category" TEXT NOT NULL,
    "riskLevel" TEXT NOT NULL,
    "outcome" TEXT NOT NULL,
    "encryptedData" TEXT NOT NULL,
    "authTag" TEXT NOT NULL,
    "checksum" TEXT NOT NULL,
    "retentionPeriod" INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 2555
) PARTITION BY RANGE ("timestamp");

-- Row-level security
ALTER TABLE "AuditEvent" ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
CREATE POLICY "audit_event_access" ON "AuditEvent"
    FOR ALL TO PUBLIC
    USING (current_setting('app.user_role') IN ('ADMIN', 'COMPLIANCE_OFFICER'));
```

### Service Architecture

```typescript
// Singleton audit service
export class AuditService {
  // Buffer events for batch processing
  private eventBuffer: AuditEvent[] = [];
  
  // Log PHI access with automatic categorization
  async logPHIAccess(params: PHIAccessParams): Promise<void>;
  
  // Query events with filtering and pagination
  async queryEvents(filters: AuditQueryFilters): Promise<AuditResults>;
  
  // Generate compliance reports
  async generateComplianceReport(params: ReportParams): Promise<ComplianceReport>;
}
```

### Middleware Integration

```typescript
// Automatic audit logging for API routes
export const GET = withAudit(handler, {
  riskMapping: { '/api/user/*': RiskLevel.MEDIUM },
  categoryMapping: { '/api/user/*': AuditEventCategory.PHI_ACCESS }
});
```
