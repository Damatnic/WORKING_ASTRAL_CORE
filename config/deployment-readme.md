## üöÄ Deployment Process

### 1. Local Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up local environment
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with local configuration

# Run database migrations
npm run prisma:migrate

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### 2. Staging Deployment

```bash
# Deploy to staging environment
./scripts/deploy/staging-deploy.sh --version staging-v1.2.3

# Run with automated tests
./scripts/deploy/staging-deploy.sh --branch feature/new-feature

# Dry run (simulation only)
./scripts/deploy/staging-deploy.sh --dry-run
```

### 3. Production Deployment

```bash
# Deploy to production
./scripts/deploy/production-deploy.sh --version v1.2.3

# Rollback if needed
./scripts/deploy/production-deploy.sh --rollback v1.2.2

# Force deployment (skip confirmations)
./scripts/deploy/production-deploy.sh --version v1.2.3 --force
```

### 4. Infrastructure Deployment

```bash
# Initialize Terraform
cd infrastructure/terraform
terraform init

# Plan infrastructure changes
terraform plan -var-file="environments/production.tfvars"

# Apply infrastructure changes
terraform apply -var-file="environments/production.tfvars"
